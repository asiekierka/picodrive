PicoDriveDS 0.1.7 - 02/04/2007
=============================================================================
- Updated for DKA r20 and latest libnds.
- Switched to libfat with [DLDI](http://chishm.drunkencoders.com/DLDI/)
support.
- Fixed bug where select key must be released quickly in order to go back to
file selection menu.
- Appended ROM check now only happens if FAT is unable to init.
- Added untested Opera RAM expansion support, and RAM support for SCCF.

=============================================================================
PicoDriveDS 0.1.6 - 11/26/2006
=============================================================================
- Added Max Media Dock FAT support (thanks chishm/Bonic)
- Added EZ4 FAT support (thanks cory1492/Rudolph)
- Reduced memory usage, 3MB ROMs should work again
- Added EXPERIMENTAL support for using the additional RAM on SuperCard SD
carts to load ROMs larger than 3MB. This comes with the standard warning that
this feature may cause file corruption on your SD card. The SCSD may also
keep the Genesis ROM in GBA ROM space after a reboot, causing PicoDriveDS to
see it as an appended ROM and crash on startup - to fix this issue simply
power down, take the SCSD out, and wait a few seconds.

=============================================================================
PicoDriveDS 0.1.5 - 08/22/2006
=============================================================================
- Added support for appended ROMs. This should allow users with carts not
supported by gba_nds_fat to use PicoDriveDS. Simply append a ROM to the
PicoDriveDS binary, and it will run it (on *nix systems this can be done with
"cat romname.ext >> picodriveds.ext", on Windows with
"copy /b picodriveds.ext+romname.ext picodriveds-withrom.ext", substituting
the appropriate filenames of course). You can only append one ROM at a time.
In this mode, Genesis SRAM will be saved to GBA SRAM. Some patchers may work
correctly with this and save the SRAM to your removable media, I have only
been able to test with the EZ4 Lite software.
- Fixed M3 reset code, added M3SD Mini insertion detection code (untested,
may not work)
- Massive code restructure and cleanup (though some cleanup is still in
progress)
- Added save state support, accessed via the X button. Due to the current
size of the save states, this is only supported for FAT devices and is
disabled in appended ROM mode. Currently there is only one save state per ROM
(saved to romname.pds). This is still a very experimental feature and save
states may not be compatible with future versions of PicoDriveDS.

=============================================================================
PicoDriveDS 0.1.4 - 06/22/2006
=============================================================================
- Fixed bug where R could scroll past end of file list
- Switched to unified builds, now one build should work for all SD/CF carts
(thanks WinterMute)
- Added NeoFlash MK2/MK3 support (thanks WinterMute)
- Changed it so that pressing Select again without choosing a file will
resume emulation

=============================================================================
PicoDriveDS 0.1.3 - 06/13/2006
=============================================================================
- Added long filename support
- Added support for going up a directory by pressing B
- Added support for skipping ahead/back 5 files at a time with R/L
- Added automatic save/load SRAM support

=============================================================================
PicoDriveDS 0.1.2 - 06/10/2006
=============================================================================
- Switched from Cyclone 0.0080 to Reesy's Cyclone 0.0084
- Switched from software scaling to hardware scaling
- Added three scale modes: Stretch, Aspect, and 1:1
- Cycle through scale modes with L
- Position the window in 1:1 mode by holding R and using the D-Pad
- Added soft reset (press select, takes you back to the ROM list)
- Added NDS banner information (shows up in WMB)

=============================================================================
PicoDriveDS 0.1.1 - 06/07/2006
=============================================================================
- Rewrote frameskip code
- IRQ/VBlank code redone to fix bug

=============================================================================
PicoDriveDS 0.1.0 - 06/07/2006
=============================================================================
Ported this over the weekend, I think it's in a state now where some people
will be able to use it. Initial reports are that it has issues running on
CF-based carts, I only have a SuperCard SD to test with so I haven't been
able to debug it on CF to see what's going on.

Copy it to your media, then copy over the Genesis ROMs you want to play
(it should be able to play ROMs with .BIN, .GEN, and .SMD extensions).
There's no sound, but since it uses the Cyclone 68k core which is optimized
for ARM it runs well for the most part. Scaling is done in-software right
now so the downscale isn't as fast or good as it could be. There's no double
buffering yet so you might see tearing on some games. Y/B/A are A/B/C.
